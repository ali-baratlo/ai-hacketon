# Persian Restaurant Review Analysis AI Pipeline

This project is a prototype AI pipeline for analyzing restaurant reviews in Persian. It takes raw review data, processes it with NLP models, and presents the insights in a realistic, customer-facing restaurant listing website.

## Key Features

-   **Realistic Web Interface**: Instead of a backend dashboard, the prototype is a sample restaurant listing website where users can browse restaurants and read reviews.
-   **AI-Generated Summaries**: Each restaurant page features a concise 2-3 sentence summary of all user comments, generated by a placeholder function for an external LLM. This gives a quick, intelligent overview of customer sentiment.
-   **Integrated Insights**: The AI summary and key positive/negative topics are seamlessly integrated into the user interface, appearing right above the individual user comments.
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Reviews are classified as positive, negative, or neutral using a pre-trained Persian BERT model. This is used to color-code comments.
-   **Aspect-Based Topic Extraction**: The system identifies the most frequently mentioned positive and negative topics (e.g., "طعم عالی," "قیمت بالا").

## How to Run

The project is designed to run locally. The Python script will perform a one-time analysis of the input data and generate a JSON file. The user interface can then be viewed directly in a browser.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser that can run local JavaScript files.
-   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.

### Steps

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open a terminal and install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Analysis Pipeline:**
    Execute the main script to process the review data. This will create or update the `data/output.json` file.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  **View the Website:**
    -   Open the `ui/index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking it or using "File > Open" in your browser).
    -   From the main page, you can click on any restaurant to see its detailed review page with the integrated AI summary.

## Project Structure

-   `main.py`: The main Python script that runs the entire analysis pipeline.
-   `data/restaurants.json`: The input file containing restaurant metadata and user reviews.
-   `data/output.json`: The output file generated by the pipeline, containing all the structured insights.
-   `ui/`: The directory containing the frontend website.
    -   `index.html`: The main restaurant listing page.
    -   `restaurant.html`: The template for individual restaurant pages.
    -   `styles.css`: The stylesheet for the website.
    -   `app.js`: The JavaScript file that dynamically builds the pages from the `output.json` data.

## External LLM for Summarization

The summarization logic has been updated to use a placeholder function (`generate_ai_summary_external`) in `main.py`. This function is designed to be replaced with a real API call to an external Large Language Model (LLM). You can find commented-out example code within the function showing how to integrate an API like OpenAI's GPT or any other service. This allows for more powerful and concise summaries than a local model could provide.
